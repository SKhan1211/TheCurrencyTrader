### Apr 27, 2020 - Introducing ORM and type-checking
* I made the decision to include TypeORM to map my chats table and any additional functions as objects because dealing with object/entry relationships might make it easier to understand for other developers
* Additionally, now that I have gained experience writing SQL based API endpoints via PostgreSQL and while I do have experience with Mongoose, practicing an ORM library for PostgreSQL will help diversify my skillset
* I have also decided to use TypeScript due to it's effectiveness in reducing bugs and time spent debugging. I will admit I was a little hesitant at first, but it's popularity swayed me and I now realize how vital it's type-checking rules can play a role in ensuring less time spent debugging previous code and more time spent on rolling out production updates
* The cost of picking up TypeScript syntax and adding in variable input types is justified by the means
