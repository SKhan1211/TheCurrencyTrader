### Apr 27, 2020 - Deploying React Components with React Hooks

* Although I am more familiar with class-based and normal functional React components, this project will utilize React hooks functional components because it will lead to noticeably less lines of code which means more time can be focused elsewhere rather than writing out long class-based components
* React hooks are also a newer more encouraged way of doing things by the creators of React, and will also help with code readability
